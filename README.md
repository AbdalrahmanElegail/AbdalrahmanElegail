## 🎓 Strong Academic Foundation  

I’m currently pursuing my **B.Sc. in Computer and Control Systems Engineering** at **Mansoura University (Faculty of Engineering)**, which has provided me with a strong theoretical and practical foundation in **computer science and software engineering**.  

Throughout my studies, I’ve covered essential subjects that directly strengthened my career as a **Full Stack Developer**, including:  

- **Programming & Software Development:** Programming Languages, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Development, Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, and Software Engineering Principles.  
- **Computer Systems & Architecture:** Logic & Digital Circuits, Microprocessor & Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, and Computer Networks (Basic & Advanced).  
- **Intelligent Systems & Data:** Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Database Systems (Design & Advanced Databases).  
- **Mathematics:** Advanced Engineering Mathematics, statistics, and probability.  

This diverse background gave me not only strong **technical depth** but also the ability to design scalable solutions, understand **low-level computing**, and apply **engineering principles** such as **SOLID, Clean Code, and software design patterns** in real-world projects.
